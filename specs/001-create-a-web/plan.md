## Implementation Plan: Slide-based PDF presenter with audio recording & evaluation

**Branch**: `001-create-a-web` | **Date**: 2025-09-19 | **Spec**: ./spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/home/jerry/workspace/comm-ai/specs/001-create-a-web/spec.md`

### Summary
Implement a frontend-only web application (Vite + React) that allows users to upload a PDF, specify their target audience, navigate slides, record audio while navigating, and upload paused segments to an evaluation webhook. Use Jotai for state, Tailwind CSS for styling, Playwright for e2e, and follow TDD with failing tests first.

### Technical Context
- Language/Version: TypeScript (ES2023 target), React 18
- Primary Dependencies: Vite, React, Jotai, Tailwind CSS, Playwright, pdf.js
- Storage: Browser memory + optional IndexedDB (offline not required now)
- Testing: Vitest for unit and component tests, Playwright for e2e
- Target Platform: Modern browsers (Chromium, Firefox, Safari)
- Project Type: Frontend-only web application
- Performance Goals: Responsive UI for PDFs up to ~200 pages; segment uploads under 10s (dependent on network)
- Constraints: Follow constitution (test-first, library-first where possible)

### Constitution Check
- Test-First principle: mandatory (we will create failing tests before implementing features)
- Integration Testing: Use Playwright to validate main user journeys
- Simplicity: Frontend-only implementation avoids backend changes; use provided webhook URL for evaluation

### Phase 0: Research (outputs saved to research.md)
- Resolve browser recording formats and server integration (product provided: accept browser formats; webhook URL provided). No offline persistence required.

### Phase 1: Design & Contracts (outputs: data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md)
- Data model focuses on client-side shape: Presentation, Slide, RecordingSegment, EvaluationResult, AudienceContext
- Contracts: OpenAPI-lite contract for the evaluation webhook (contracts/evaluation-api.yaml)
- Quickstart: step-by-step dev run and test instructions

### Phase 2: Task Planning approach
- Tasks will be generated to support TDD ordering: tests for PDF rendering, recording controls, upload-on-pause, contract test mocks, and e2e scenarios.

### Progress Tracking
- Phase 0: Done
- Phase 1: Done (contracts and data model created)
- Phase 2: Planned (tasks.md will be generated by /tasks)
