# Research: UI Redesign

## Decision: Define "sleek and professional" design principles
- Clean, minimal layout with generous white space
- Subtle shadows and borders for depth
- Consistent typography hierarchy
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- High contrast for accessibility
- Smooth transitions and hover effects

**Rationale**: These principles create a modern, trustworthy appearance that enhances usability without overwhelming the user. They align with current web design best practices and maintain the existing Tailwind CSS design system.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Dark mode: Considered but rejected as it may not suit all users and requires more complex implementation.
- Custom color scheme: Rejected to maintain consistency with existing design system.
- Complex animations: Rejected as they could distract from functionality.

## Decision: Responsiveness improvements
- Use Tailwind's responsive utilities (sm:, md:, lg:)
- Mobile-first approach with stacked layouts on small screens
- Flexible grid systems for component arrangement

**Rationale**: Ensures the application works well on all devices, improving accessibility and user satisfaction.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Fixed-width design: Rejected as it doesn't support mobile users.
- Separate mobile app: Rejected due to scope constraints and existing web focus.

## Decision: Accessibility compliance
- Semantic HTML elements
- Proper ARIA labels for interactive elements
- Keyboard navigation support
- High contrast color ratios (WCAG AA compliant)
- Screen reader friendly structure

**Rationale**: Ensures the application is usable by all users, including those with disabilities, which is both ethical and potentially legally required.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Basic accessibility: Insufficient for professional standards.
- Advanced features like voice control: Out of scope for this redesign.

## Decision: Maintain existing functionality
- No changes to core features (PDF upload, recording, segment management)
- Preserve all user interactions and workflows
- Keep existing API integrations intact

**Rationale**: The requirement explicitly states "Don't change any feature", so all existing behavior must be preserved.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Feature enhancements: Rejected as they violate the specification.
