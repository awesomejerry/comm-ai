# Feature Specification: UI Redesign

**Feature Branch**: `002-re-design-the`  
**Created**: September 20, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Re-design the whole user interface. Use existing design system. Make it look sleek and professional and user-friendly. Don't change any feature."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want the interface to be redesigned to look sleek, professional, and user-friendly while keeping all existing features intact, so that I can have a better visual experience without losing functionality.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the application is loaded, **When** the user views the interface, **Then** the design appears sleek and professional.
2. **Given** the user interacts with features, **When** performing actions, **Then** all existing features work as before.
3. **Given** the design system is used, **When** the UI is rendered, **Then** it adheres to the existing design system guidelines.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when users access the application on mobile devices? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Ensure responsiveness is maintained or improved]
- How does the system handle accessibility features like screen readers? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Confirm accessibility compliance]
- What if the existing design system has limitations for sleekness? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Define what "sleek" means within the constraints]

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST maintain all existing features without any changes to functionality.
- **FR-002**: System MUST utilize the existing design system for consistency.
- **FR-003**: System MUST present a sleek and professional visual appearance.
- **FR-004**: System MUST be user-friendly, improving usability where possible without altering features.
- **FR-005**: System MUST ensure the redesign does not introduce new bugs or break existing workflows.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- No new data entities are introduced; existing entities remain unchanged.
