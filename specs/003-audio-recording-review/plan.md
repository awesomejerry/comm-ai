# Implementation Plan: Audio Recording Review Before Uploading

**Branch**: `003-audio-recording-review` | **Date**: 2025-09-21 | **Spec**: /home/jerry/workspace/comm-ai/specs/003-audio-recording-review/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/003-audio-recording-review/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)

```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:

- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary

Add audio review functionality to the existing recording system. When users pause recording, they can listen to the recorded audio, then choose to confirm upload for evaluation or delete the recording. Implementation uses the current tech stack (TypeScript, React, Vite, Tailwind CSS) to extend the recording controller and UI components with playback controls and action buttons.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x, Node.js  
**Primary Dependencies**: React 18, Vite, Tailwind CSS, pdf.js  
**Storage**: Local browser storage for audio blobs, server upload for evaluation  
**Testing**: Vitest (unit), Playwright (e2e)  
**Target Platform**: Web browser  
**Project Type**: web  
**Performance Goals**: Standard web app responsiveness (<100ms UI interactions)  
**Constraints**: Browser audio APIs, microphone permissions, network upload  
**Scale/Scope**: Single user session, audio recordings up to several minutes

## Constitution Check

_GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design._

**Test-First Principle**: ✅ All new functionality will begin with failing tests in Vitest for unit tests and Playwright for e2e tests.

**Contract & Integration Safety**: ✅ The upload to evaluation webhook will maintain existing contract tests. New review actions will be tested via integration tests.

**Modular, Library-First Design**: ✅ Will extend existing recordingController and uploader services with clear interfaces. No large coupled files.

**Observability & Robust Error Handling**: ✅ Will add structured logging for review/playback actions. Error states for failed uploads or audio issues will be handled with user feedback.

**Simplicity, Incremental Change & Semantic Versioning**: ✅ Simple extension of existing recording flow. No breaking changes to public interfaces.

**Spec-Driven Development**: ✅ Following spec → plan → tasks → implement workflow.

**Precise Commit Messages**: ✅ All commits will follow one-line descriptive format with type prefixes.

**Structure Decision**: Option 2: Web application (frontend in src/, backend server.js)

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:

   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:

   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

_Prerequisites: research.md complete_

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:

   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:

   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:

   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:

   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh copilot` for your AI assistant
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/\*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach

_This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan_

**Task Generation Strategy**:

- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P]
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:

- TDD order: Tests before implementation
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation

_These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command_

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking

_Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified_

| Violation                  | Why Needed         | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
| -------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| [e.g., 4th project]        | [current need]     | [why 3 projects insufficient]        |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient]  |

## Progress Tracking

_This checklist is updated during execution flow_

**Phase Status**:

- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [x] Phase 3: Tasks generated and executed (/tasks command + implementation)
- [x] Phase 4: Implementation complete (all code written and tested)
- [x] Phase 5: Validation passed (all tests passing)

**Gate Status**:

- [x] Initial Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved
- [x] Complexity deviations documented (none required - implementation stayed within scope)
