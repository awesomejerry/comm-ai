# Research: Audio Recording Review Before Uploading

## Phase 0 Findings

### Extracted Unknowns from Technical Context

- How to implement audio playback for review in the browser
- Best practices for audio controls in React/TypeScript
- Handling audio blob playback without saving to file system
- UI/UX patterns for review controls (play/pause/seek)

### Research Tasks Completed

#### Task: Research browser audio playback for review functionality

**Decision**: Use HTML5 Audio API with blob URLs for playback
**Rationale**:

- Native browser support, no additional dependencies needed
- Can create object URLs from MediaRecorder blobs
- Integrates well with existing recording system
- Supports standard audio controls (play, pause, seek)

**Alternatives considered**:

- Web Audio API: More complex, overkill for simple playback
- Third-party libraries (e.g., wavesurfer.js): Adds dependencies, not necessary for basic review

#### Task: Find best practices for audio controls in React/TypeScript

**Decision**: Custom React component with useRef for audio element
**Rationale**:

- Follows existing component patterns in the codebase
- TypeScript support for audio events
- Controlled component approach for state management
- Consistent with Tailwind CSS styling

**Alternatives considered**:

- HTML5 audio element directly: Less React integration
- Audio libraries: Unnecessary complexity for simple controls

#### Task: Handling audio blob playback without file system

**Decision**: Create object URLs from blobs, revoke after use
**Rationale**:

- Browser security: blobs don't need file system access
- Memory efficient: revoke URLs to free resources
- Compatible with existing MediaRecorder output
- No server round-trip needed for review

**Alternatives considered**:

- Base64 encoding: Larger memory footprint
- File system API: Not universally supported, overkill

#### Task: UI/UX patterns for review controls

**Decision**: Simple play/pause button with progress indicator
**Rationale**:

- Matches existing UI simplicity
- Clear visual feedback for playback state
- Accessible with keyboard navigation
- Consistent with recording controls

**Alternatives considered**:

- Full audio player with timeline: Too complex for review use case
- Waveform visualization: Adds dependencies, not essential

### Integration Points

- Extend existing `recordingController.ts` to support review state
- Add review UI to `PresenterPage.tsx`
- Maintain existing upload flow after confirmation
- Add delete functionality before upload

### No Remaining NEEDS CLARIFICATION

All technical unknowns resolved using current tech stack capabilities.
