# Feature Specification: Audio Recording Review Before Uploading

**Feature Branch**: `003-audio-recording-review`  
**Created**: 2025-09-21  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "audio recording review before uploading. Users should be able to review their recording (listen to it) when they pause the recording. And once they confirm, it gets uploaded to the sever (same as before) to be evaluated. Users can delete recording if they are not satisfied before uploading."

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a user recording audio for evaluation, I want to be able to pause the recording, review it by listening, and then either confirm to upload it for evaluation or delete it if I'm not satisfied, so that I can ensure the quality of my recording before submitting it.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a user is recording audio and pauses the recording, **When** the recording is paused, **Then** a review section appears allowing them to listen to the recorded audio.
2. **Given** a user is reviewing the paused recording, **When** the audio playback completes, **Then** the system transitions to a reviewed state enabling upload confirmation or deletion.
3. **Given** a user has reviewed the recording and is satisfied with it, **When** they click the "Confirm & Upload" button, **Then** the recording is uploaded to the server for evaluation (same as before).
4. **Given** a user has reviewed the recording and is not satisfied with it, **When** they click the "Delete Recording" button, **Then** the recording is discarded and not uploaded.
5. **Given** a recording has been confirmed and uploaded, **When** the upload completes, **Then** the system returns to the ready state allowing a new recording to begin.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the user pauses recording but the recording is empty or too short?
- How does the system handle if the user pauses but doesn't perform any review action?
- What if the upload fails after the user confirms?
- How does the system prevent accidental deletion or upload?
