# Research: Apply Branding to the App and Revamp the User Interface

## Research Tasks

- Research modern UI design principles for professional pitch training applications
- Research branding elements for "Comm-AI" (color scheme, typography, logo concepts)
- Research how to make the interface "totally different" from current implementation
- Research performance goals for web UI (if applicable)

## Findings

### Design Criteria Definitions

- **Appealing**: Visual theme achieves >80% user preference in A/B testing or aligns with professional pitch app aesthetics (e.g., clean, trustworthy colors like blues/grays).
- **Simple**: Layout uses <5 UI elements per screen, with clear hierarchy and no cluttered navigation.
- **Modern**: Incorporates current design trends like ample whitespace, sans-serif fonts (e.g., Inter), and consistent spacing (8px grid).
- **Intuitive**: Users complete primary tasks (e.g., start presentation) in <3 clicks, with self-explanatory icons and labels.

### Decision: Modern UI Design Principles

- Use clean, minimal design with ample whitespace
- Employ a professional color palette (blues, grays, whites)
- Utilize sans-serif fonts for readability
- Implement card-based layouts for content organization
- Add subtle animations for interactivity

**Rationale**: Aligns with "appealing, simple, modern" requirements.

**Alternatives Considered**: Dark mode, complex layouts - rejected for simplicity.

### Decision: Comm-AI Branding

- Primary color: Professional blue (#1e40af)
- Secondary colors: Gray (#6b7280), White (#ffffff)
- Typography: Inter or similar modern sans-serif
- Logo: Text-based "Comm-AI" with subtle icon

**Rationale**: Professional appearance suitable for pitch training.

**Alternatives Considered**: Vibrant colors - rejected for professionalism.

### Decision: Totally Different Interface

**Current UI Characteristics** (based on codebase review):

- Centered layout with basic buttons and forms
- Default browser styling with minimal custom CSS
- Functional but plain appearance

**New UI Differences**:

- Shift to card-based, modern layout with branded colors and typography
- Replace generic components with custom-styled ones (e.g., rounded buttons, shadows)
- Add responsive grid and mobile-optimized interactions
- Embrace minimalism: reduce visual noise, increase whitespace

**Rationale**: Meets "totally different" requirement.

**Alternatives Considered**: Incremental changes - rejected per spec.

### Decision: Performance Goals

- UI load time < 2 seconds
- Responsive interactions < 100ms

**Rationale**: Standard web performance expectations.

**Alternatives Considered**: Stricter goals - not necessary for UI changes.</content>
