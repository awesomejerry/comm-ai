# Feature Specification: Apply Branding to the App and Revamp the User Interface

**Feature Branch**: `004-apply-branding-to`  
**Created**: 2025-09-25  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Apply branding to the app and revamp the user interface. The web app is called "Comm-AI". It's a professional pitch training web app. The interface and theme should be appealing. Embrace simplicity. Utilize modern design. The user interface should be totally different from current implementation. It should be intuitive and easy-to-use."

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-25

- Q: What are the responsive design requirements for mobile devices? ‚Üí A: Fully responsive design supporting all screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Q: What accessibility standards should the design meet for users with visual impairments? ‚Üí A: No specific accessibility standards required
- Q: What should happen if the branding elements (e.g., logo, custom fonts) fail to load? ‚Üí A: Show generic placeholder text or icons

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a user of the Comm-AI pitch training web app, I want the interface to be branded as "Comm-AI", appealing, simple, modern, intuitive, and easy-to-use, so that I can focus on my pitch training without distractions.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** the app is loaded, **When** I view the interface, **Then** it displays "Comm-AI" branding prominently and has a modern, professional design.
2. **Given** the current user interface, **When** the revamp is applied, **Then** the new interface is totally different, embracing simplicity and being more intuitive.
3. **Given** a PDF is uploaded, **When** I view the interface on desktop, **Then** the recording controls appear on the left and the presentation preview appears on the right.
4. **Given** the interface layout, **When** viewed on different screen sizes, **Then** the layout adapts responsively with columns stacking on mobile devices.

### Edge Cases

- The interface supports fully responsive design for all screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- The design does not require specific accessibility standards for users with visual impairments
- If branding elements fail to load, show generic placeholder text or icons
- On desktop screens, the layout uses two columns with recording controls on the left and presentation preview on the right
- The left column auto-sizes to fit its content, giving more space to the presentation preview
- The main content container uses 80% of the screen width for optimal space utilization

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST display "Comm-AI" branding prominently in the interface
- **FR-002**: System MUST have an appealing visual theme suitable for professional pitch training
- **FR-003**: System MUST embrace simplicity in its design elements and layout
- **FR-004**: System MUST utilize modern design principles (e.g., clean typography, ample whitespace, consistent spacing)
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide a user interface that is totally different from the current implementation
- **FR-006**: System MUST be intuitive and easy-to-use for users engaging in pitch training
- **FR-007**: System MUST support fully responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop screen sizes
- **FR-008**: System MUST display generic placeholder text or icons if branding elements fail to load
- **FR-009**: System MUST use a two-column horizontal layout on desktop with recording controls on the left and presentation preview on the right
- **FR-010**: System MUST auto-size the left column to fit content and allocate remaining space to the presentation preview
- **FR-011**: System MUST use 80% of screen width for the main content container

### Design Decisions

- **Layout Structure**: Two-column horizontal layout on desktop screens, with recording controls on the left and presentation preview on the right
- **Column Sizing**: Left column auto-sizes to fit content, right column takes remaining space
- **Container Width**: Uses 80% of screen width for optimal space utilization
- **Responsive Behavior**: Columns stack vertically on mobile and tablet devices
- **Content Organization**: PDF upload card appears above the main content grid

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Branding Element**: Represents the "Comm-AI" identity, including logo, color scheme, and typography
- **User Interface Component**: Represents interactive elements like buttons, forms, and navigation, designed for simplicity and intuitiveness
