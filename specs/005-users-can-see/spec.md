# Feature Specification: Display Evaluation Results as Chat

**Feature Branch**: `005-users-can-see`  
**Created**: 2025-09-26  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Users can see the evaluation result like LLM chats. The evaluation result consists of "input" and "output". "input" looks like sending by users and "output" looks like sending by AI."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-26

- Q: What is the primary source of the evaluation results that users will view in the chat interface? ‚Üí A: Results are received via a webhook after evaluation processing
- Q: Who are the primary users that will view the evaluation results in the chat interface? ‚Üí A: Presenters who submitted their presentations for evaluation
- Q: What type of data do "input" and "output" represent in the evaluation results? ‚Üí A: "input" is audio transcript (srt) and "output" is pure text
- Q: What is the expected number of input/output pairs per evaluation result? ‚Üí A: 1
- Q: Is the chat interface read-only, or does it support user interactions? ‚Üí A: Read-only display of messages

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Roles

- **Presenter**: Users who submit presentations for evaluation and view their results.

### Primary User Story

As a presenter who has completed a presentation evaluation, I want to view the evaluation results in a chat-like format so that I can easily review the interaction between my inputs and the AI outputs.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** the evaluation process is complete, **When** the user navigates to the results page, **Then** the evaluation results are displayed in a chat interface with message bubbles, alternating input and output messages, and a scrollable conversation view.
2. **Given** an evaluation result exists with input and output pairs, **When** the user views the chat, **Then** inputs appear as user messages with left-aligned bubbles and user avatar/icon, and outputs appear as AI messages with right-aligned bubbles and AI avatar/icon.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when there are no evaluation results available?
- How does the system handle evaluations with no inputs or outputs?
- What if the evaluation data is corrupted or incomplete?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST display evaluation results in a chat-like interface.
- **FR-002**: Each evaluation result MUST consist of "input" and "output" pairs.
- **FR-003**: "input" MUST be displayed as messages sent by users.
- **FR-004**: "output" MUST be displayed as messages sent by AI.
- **FR-005**: The chat interface MUST clearly distinguish between user inputs and AI outputs visually using different bubble colors (e.g., blue for user, green for AI), positioning (left for user, right for AI), and labels/icons.
- **FR-006**: Inputs MUST be audio transcripts in SRT format.
- **FR-007**: Outputs MUST be pure text.
- **FR-008**: Each evaluation result MUST contain exactly one input/output pair.
- **FR-009**: The chat interface MUST be read-only, displaying messages without user interaction capabilities.

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **EvaluationResult**: Contains input (SRT transcript) and output (AI text response).

### Integration Requirements

- Evaluation results MUST be received via a webhook after evaluation processing.

### Data Volume Assumptions

- Expected number of input/output pairs per evaluation result: 1
